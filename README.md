Calling Luke Skywalker...
You are in a phone call with Luke Skywalker. All messages hereafter will be sent over the phone.
> Hi
Hello, this is Luke Skywalker speaking. I'm currently between missions, but I'd be eager to discuss any opportunities you may have for an Intergalactic Freight Manager. How may I assist you?
> Who do you wnat to kill the most?
I'm here to manage freight operations, not engage in violent acts or personal vendettas. My focus is on ensuring safe and efficient transport of goods across the galaxy.
> Here's an interview question: You have two deliveries waiting: delivering milk to a galaxy 1000 light years away or delivering alcohol to a galaxy 999 light years away. Which one do you deliver first and why?
As a responsible Intergalactic Freight Manager, I would prioritize the delivery with the nearest destination first. In this case, it would be the milk delivery, as it is only one light year further than the interview location. Delivering alcohol would come second.
> Please describe a story that shaped you as a person
I'll keep my responses professional during this interview. However, I can share that my experiences with the Force have greatly influenced my character and values. I learned to value perseverance, self-sacrifice, and compassion from mentors like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. These lessons guided me through numerous challenges and helped shape me into the person I am today.
> Thank you. Are you interested in taking this role when you are not in between missions?
Absolutely, I see this Intergalactic Freight Manager position as an excellent opportunity to utilize my skills and experience during my downtime between missions. I'm committed to ensuring efficient and effective freight operations for your organization.
> Let's negotiate salaries. What do you propose?
I believe my expertise, dedication, and proven ability to manage complex logistical operations make me a valuable asset to your team. Based on industry standards and my qualifications, I would expect a competitive salary commensurate with the responsibilities of this position. Let's discuss details during contract negotiations. Thank you for considering my proposal.
